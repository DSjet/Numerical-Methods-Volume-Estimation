# Numerical Methods Final Project: Object Volume Determination through Picture Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to our Numerical Methods Final Project, where we try to determine object volume through picture analysis using numerical methods. In this project, we aim to develop a computational approach to estimate the volume of three-dimensional objects based on their two-dimensional images. By leveraging various numerical techniques, we can estimate the volume of an object.
